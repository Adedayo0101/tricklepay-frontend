// Mirrors the tricklepay-backend API response. Amounts are held as strings
// because Soroban uses 128-bit integers for balances, which exceed JavaScript's
// MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. Parsing an amount as a Number or using parseFloat() risks
// silent loss of precision (e.g. truncating the lowest digits).
//
// To convert an amount for display, do not cast it to a Number. Instead, use
// `formatAmount(string)` from `lib/format.ts`, which safely computes the
// fractional representation using BigInt math.
//
// Times are Unix-second strings for the same precision reason.
