/**
 * Owns the single wallet session for the whole app. This provider centralizes
 * connection state so that every component reads the same address, sees
 * disconnects immediately, and benefits from automatic session restoration.
 * 
 * The state is shared rather than per-component because:
 * - Wallet connection is inherently global — only one address is active at a time
 * - Multiple components need the address (header, forms, stream details)
 * - Disconnecting in one place should update the whole UI instantly
 * - Freighter should be probed once per page load, not once per consumer
 * 
 * On mount, the provider attempts to restore an existing session if Freighter
 * has already authorized this app, so returning users remain connected across
 * page refreshes without re-prompting.
 * 
 * Consumers receive:
 * - address: the connected wallet's public key, or null when disconnected
 * - network: the network the wallet is on (normalized to lowercase), or null
 * - connecting: true during the connect flow
 * - error: most recent connection error message, or null
 * - connect(): prompts the user to authorize via Freighter
 * - disconnect(): clears the session and resets all state
 * 
 * Mount this once in the root layout and access it anywhere via useWallet().
 * 
 * @param children - The app tree that needs wallet state.
